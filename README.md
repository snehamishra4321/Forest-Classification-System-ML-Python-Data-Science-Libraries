# Forest-Classification-System
- Analysed the forest dataset to determine the forest cover type using ML models and EDA.
- Applied various classification models using algorithms such as Support vector machines (SVM), Random Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, K-Nearest Neighbour,   Normal Bayes classifier, etc to find optimal method to classify forest cover type with hyperparameters tuning.
- Created visualizations for anomaly detection and used cross-validation for enhancing prediction accuracy by 18% along with increase in performance parameters between models.

Steps:

1. Select the appropriate machine learning model: Select the appropriate machine learning model based on the type of data and the desired outcome. For example, if the data is structured and the desired outcome is a binary classifier, then a logistic regression model may be the best choice.

2. Pre-process the data: Pre-process the data by normalizing it, removing outliers, and transforming it into a format that the machine learning model can understand.

3. Train and evaluate the model: Train the model on the pre-processed data and evaluate its performance. This can be done by splitting the data into training and testing sets and using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model’s performance.

4. Tune the model: Once the model is trained and evaluated, tune the model to find the best combination of hyperparameters that maximize the model’s performance. This can be done using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

5. Test the model: Finally, use the tuned model to make predictions on unseen data and evaluate its performance. If the model performs well on the unseen data, it can be deployed in production.
